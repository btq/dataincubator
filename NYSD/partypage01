Mother and daughter co-hosts (R-L) Ruth Buchanan and Bonnie Matheson. Ruth told her guests: "I watched both of my late husbands have terribly painful and drawn-out deaths because they didn't plan ahead [by naming resolute healthcare proxies and completing comprehensive advance directives]. They hadn't spoken to their families about their own deeply held end-of-life values and shared what truly living meant to them. I hope each of you — including my own children and grandchildren — gathered here will not make the same mistakes.
